# ScrollbarIssue

When you run the application there will be a ScrollView in the top left corner.
Inside this ScrollView is button. Pressing that button will insert more buttons on top of it.
The point of this is to show that the scrollbar does not update until one starts scrolling, meaning that all of a sudden it will teleport when one starts to scroll.
